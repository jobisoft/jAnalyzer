# jAnalyzer
Tool to analyze raw data files (dat files) created by [jDaqLite](https://github.com/jobisoft/jDaqLite). It uses the ROOT framework to extract and display the timing information from the data and also calculates the width of each TDC bin according to the *white noise assumption* as used by the jTDC modules.
